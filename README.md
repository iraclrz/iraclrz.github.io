# Personal Portfolio Website
The Personal Portfolio Website, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcases your skills and experiences across six sections. The homepage introduces visitors, while the "About Me" section provides deeper insights into your background and interests. Your work experiences are highlighted, and the centerpiece "My Portfolio" section categorizes projects into "All Projects," "Web/App Development," and "Data Analytics," allowing visitors to explore each project in detail. A dedicated contact form enables seamless communication, and visitors can download your CV/resume. With its responsive design and social media integration, the website offers a professional platform for presenting your expertise and fostering engagement with potential clients, employers, or collaborators.
